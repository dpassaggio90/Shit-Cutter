# Shit-Cutter

https://i.ibb.co/PYMc6Z1/Screenshot.png



This is a program written in Python to allow video editors to speed up the Pre Cut process. It takes care of locating in the clips the most stable seconds and delete the part too moved.

Python 3.8 and the libraries :
ffmpeg , tkinter , moviepy , opencv-python (installed with the command pip install from the terminal).

Currently the program works, but it is not yet perfect, it does not digest well the 4K files that send it in panic and could crash, instead in Full Hd 1080p manages to manage multiple clips at once.

This is an open project, uploaded here so that you can improve it together!
